## Projects

### Image Similarity Search (ResNet50, FAISS, SQLite) [\[Github\]](https://github.com/playatanu/similarity-search) [\[YouTube\]](https://youtu.be/DWbKI3PEZNs?si=7EcLrH-cwWlWIWQa)

- Developed a deep learning-powered image search system using ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet) for feature extraction and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for nearest searches across large-scale image datasets.
- Integrated SQLite to store image metadata (e.g., file paths,) and link them to FAISS indices.

### Virtual Hair Colour Try on System (U-Net, Flask, Docker) [\[Github\]](https://github.com/playatanu/hair-color-try-on) [\[YouTube\]](https://youtu.be/sNUbNRr4ztg?si=mpaRw_73p_MHooXA) [\[YouTube\]](https://hair-colour-82219561125.asia-south1.run.app/)

- Developed a deep learning-based virtual hair colour try-on system using U-Net for precise hair segmentation and realistic colour transformation.
- Built a web application using Flask, enabling a user-friendly hair colour visualization experience.
- Deployed the application using Docker on Google Cloud to ensure scalability, reliability, and seamless accessibility across platforms.

### Blood Cell Detection (Faster R-CNN) [\[Github\]](https://github.com/playatanu/blood-cell-detection)

- Developed a blood cell detection system using Faster R-CNN for from microscopic images.
- Accurately identified and classified Red Blood Cells (RBC), White Blood Cells (WBC), and Platelets for medical analysis.

### Smart Parking System (YOLO, OCR) [\[Github\]](https://github.com/playatanu/smart-car-parking) [\[YouTube\]](https://youtu.be/FyBBYTRnlsc?si=LGyUwv4u5-Oz0T74)

- Developed a Smart Parking System for real-time vehicle detection, tracking, and monitoring.
- Implemented object tracking to uniquely identify vehicles and prevent duplicate counts.
- Integrated number plate detection using YOLO and OCR to extract and store license plate details along with timestamps.

### Android Based Object Detection System (Flutter, YOLO) [\[Github\]](https://github.com/playatanu/object-detection-app) [\[YouTube\]](https://youtu.be/nUj9VhqMpEA?si=5YGxTDw7Faim4RWZ)

- Developed an object detection system for visually impaired users using Flutter and YOLO.
- Implemented multiple object detection models, including currency detection, and road obstacle detection with TTS (Text to Speech) voice-based alerts to provide object identification feedback.

### Face Recognition System (FaceNet) [\[Github\]](https://github.com/playatanu/face-recognition-app) [\[YouTube\]](https://youtu.be/ay6WTBdphlc?si=RpjOypM44tKzHD43)

- Developed a Face Recognition System using FaceNet for accurate and efficient face identification.
- Designed an interactive, user-friendly web application with Streamlit.
